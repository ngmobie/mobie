<h3>Select</h3>

<p><code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element is styled so its appearance is prettied up relative to the browser's default style. However, when the select elements is opened, the default behavior on how to select one of the options is still managed by the browser.</p>

<p>Each platform's user-interface will be different as the user is selecting an option. For example, on a desktop browser you'll see the traditional drop down interface, whereas Android often has a radio-button list popup, and iOS has a custom scroller covering the bottom half of the window.</p>
