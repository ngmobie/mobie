<h3>Checkbox</h3>

<p>A checkbox is no different than the HTML checkbox input, except it's styled differently. This is an example of multiple checkboxes within a list. Note the item-checkbox class was added along side item for each item.</p>

<p>We prefers to use the &lt;label&gt; element for a checkbox item in order to make the entire checkbox tappable.</p>

<p>Checkboxes can also have colors assigned to them, such as checkbox-assertive to assign the assertive color.</p>
