<h3>List</h3>

<p>The List is a common and simple way of displaying... that's right, a list. This is a widely used interface across most current mobile OS's, and can include content ranging from basic text all the way to buttons, toggles, icons, and thumbnails.</p>

<p>The list view is a very versatile and powerful component. List views support various interaction modes such as editing, swipe to edit, drag to reorder, and pull to refresh.</p>

<p>For more power you can use Ionic's AngularJS directives. Check out the AngularJS list docs to get more detailed information.</p>
