<h3>Block Buttons</h3>

<p>Adding <code>button-block</code> to a button applies <code>display: block</code> display. A block button will however go 100% of its parent's width. In the example, the button's containing content element also has <code>padding</code> applied, so there is some breathing room between the edge of the device and the buttons.</p>
