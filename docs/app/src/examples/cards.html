<h3>Cards</h3>

<p>Cards have become widely used in recent years. They're are a great way to contain and organize information, while also setting up predictable expectations for the user. With so much content to display at once, and often so little screen realestate, cards have fast become the design pattern of choice for many companies, including the likes of Google, Twitter, and Spotify..</p>

<p>For mobile experiences, Cards make it easy to display the same information visually across many different screen sizes. They allow for more control, are flexible, and can even be animated. Cards are usually placed on top of one another, but they can also be used like a "page" and swiped between, left and right.</p>

<mb-highlight language="html"><pre><code>
<div class="card">
  <div class="item item-text-wrap">
    This is a basic Card which contains an item that has wrapping text.
  </div>
</div>
</code></pre></mb-highlight>

<p>Cards add a box-shadow by default, whereas it's cousin list list-inset does not. For performance reasons, when scrolling a large card with many items its recommended to use inset lists instead.</p>
