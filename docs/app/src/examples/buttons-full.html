<h3>Full Width Buttons</h3>

<p>Adding <code>button-full</code> class to a button not only applies <code>display: block</code>, but also removes borders on the left and right, and any border-radius which may be applied. This style is useful when the button should stretch across the entire width of the display. Additionally, the button's parent element does not have <code>padding</code> applied.</p>
